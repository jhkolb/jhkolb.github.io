    <p>
       I recently completed my PhD in computer science at the
       <a href='https://eecs.berkeley.edu'>University of California, Berkeley</a>.
       I am broadly interested in operating systems and distributed computing.
       I have also done research on applications of machine learning to
       education. I was part of the <a href='https://bets.cs.berkeley.edu'>
       Building, Energy, and Transportation Systems (BETS)</a> lab, a
       subsidiary of Berkeley's <a href='https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu'>
       Rise Lab</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
       I received an M.S. in computer science at Berkeley for my work as part of
       the Software Defined Buildings project (the predecessor of BETS).

    <p>
       I received a B.S. in computer science from the <a href='https://www.cs.umn.edu'>
       University of Minnesota</a>, where I was a member of the
       <a href='https://grouplens.org'>GroupLens</a> research lab as well as the
       <a href='http://dcsg.cs.umn.edu'>Distributed Computing Systems Group</a>.
